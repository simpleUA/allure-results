the most effective strategies for how to learn can help you maximize your efforts when you are trying to learn new ideas, concepts, and skills. If you are like many people, your time is limited, so it is important to get the most educational value out of the time you have.\n\nSpeed of learning is not the only important factor, however. It is important to be able to accurately remember the information that you learn, recall it at a later time, and use it effectively in a wide variety of situations.\n\nKnowing how to learn well is not something that happens overnight, but putting a few of these learning techniques into daily practice can help you get more out of your study time.There are a number of different strategies that can boost memory. Basic tips such as improving your focus, avoiding cram sessions, and structuring your study time are good places to start, but there are even more lessons from psychology that can dramatically improve your learning efficiency.\n\nStrategies that can help improve your memory include:\n\nGetting regular physical exercise, which is linked to improvements in memory and brain health1\nSpending time socializing with other people\nGetting enough sleep2\nEliminating distractions so you can focus on what you are learning\nOrganizing the information you are studying to make it easier to remember3\nUsing elaborative rehearsal when studying; when you learn something new, spend a few moments describing it to yourself in your own words\nUsing visual aids like photographs, graphs, and charts\nReading the information you are studying out loud4\nFor example, you might use general learning techniques like setting aside quiet time to study, rehearsing, and reading information aloud. You might combine this with strategies that can foster better memory, such as exercising and socializing.One sure-fire way to become a more effective learner is to simply keep learning. Research has found that the brain is capable of producing new brain cells, a process known as neurogenesis. However, many of these cells will eventually die unless a person engages in some type of effortful learning.\nBy learning new things, these cells are kept alive and incorporated into brain circuits.5\n\nSo, if you are learning a new language, it is important to keep practicing the language in order to maintain the gains you have achieved. This \"use-it-or-lose-it\" phenomenon involves a brain process known as \"pruning.\"\n\nIn pruning, certain pathways in the brain are maintained, while others are eliminated. If you want the new information you just learned to stay put, keep practicing and rehearsing it.Another one of the best ways to learn is to focus on learning in more than one way. For example, instead of just listening to a podcast, which involves auditory learning, find a way to rehearse the information both verbally and visually.\n\nThis might involve describing what you learned to a friend, taking notes, or drawing a mind map. By learning in more than one way, you’re furth"}],"start":1671726639196,"stop":1671726645433},{"name":"chooseChallenge","status":"passed","stage":"finished","steps":[],"attachments":[],"parameters":[],"start":1671726645433,"stop":1671726645566},{"name":"clickSave","status":"passed","stage":"finished","steps":[],"attachments":[],"parameters":[],"start":1671726645566,"stop":1671726648611}],"attachments":[],"parameters":[],"start":1671726605307,"stop":1671726648616}
